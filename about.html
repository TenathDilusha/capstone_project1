<h1>About me</h1>
<p>I am a passionate and dedicated Computer Science and Engineering student with a strong interest in software development, artificial intelligence, and data science. I thrive on solving complex problems and continuously expanding my knowledge in programming, web development, and game development.
    With expertise in Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, and React, I have built applications ranging from mobile weather apps to 2D platformer games. My experience includes RESTful API development, database management (PostgreSQL, SQLite), cloud computing (GCP), and object-oriented programming.  
    Beyond coding, I am an avid chess player (FIDE 1600+), a curious learner, and a problem-solver. I believe in continuous self-improvement, as reflected in my reading of books like Atomic Habits and The 5AM Club. I also enjoy engaging in citizen science projects, such as RainPULSE, where I contribute to improving rainfall prediction in Sri Lanka.  
    
    I am always eager to take on new challenges and collaborate on innovative projects that push the boundaries of technology. ðŸš€</p>
